                        I'm currently studying Computer Science at UCLA. I'm involved with UAS@UCLA (Unmanned Aerial Systems) as an
                        interface developer for an autonomous drone using ReactJS and Electron. UCLA is teaching me the values of 
                        hard work, perseverance, and proactivity and I can't wait to seize my opportunities and make the most out of them!

                        FIRST Robotics gave me the incredible opportunity to really grow as a person. Not only have I vastly improved my coding,
                        I've also learned to work with others, to create unique and creative solutions, to teach myself, to document my progress, 
                        and to communicate with others. FIRST has given me so much more than any list can describe and is largely responsible for 
                        making me the person I am today.

                        ChinaWay presented me with a golden opportunity to interact with others from an entirely different background
                        and to exchange knowledge like no other. It taught me how to be patient, how to explain things from different
                        perspectives, and how to problem solve with limited utility. Most important of all, ChinaWay gave me the love
                        of teaching, which I carried back to my robotics teams and hope to carry with me throughout the rest of my life.

                Music means the world to me. I've stopped taking lessons long ago, but you might still
                be able to catch me playing the piano from time to time. Here are my favorite playlists

                        Bops, jams, ballets, and songs from South Korea. Some new, some
                        old. Some powerful, some fun. Some popular, some hidden. Constantly
